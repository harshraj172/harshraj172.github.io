I am Harsh Raj, an __Applied Scientist__ at [__VijilAI__](https://www.vijil.ai/) working on red-teaming and evaluating Langauge Models. 

<!-- Also, [__NLP Course__ <span style="color:#92bf32">__For You__</span>](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course.html) creator and current [SIGREP](https://www.sigrep.org) president. -->

Broadly, I am interested in making language models safe, useful, and controllable. Over the past few years, I have taken my first baby steps as a researcher, owing to some wonderful people and collaborations. 

Most recently, I am working with some folks from [CSAI](https://www.safe.ai/) (particularly [Dom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=80aJAKYAAAAJ&hl=en)) on mitigating finetuning attacks on LLMs and reward hacking as a consequence of it. Being an Applied Scientist at [VijilAI](https://www.vijil.ai/), I am working on building the largest database of red teaming prompts with [Leif](https://boltzmann-brain.github.io/).

Before that, I worked with [Subho](https://www.subhomajumdar.com/), Dom, and [Vipul](https://vipulgupta1011.github.io/) on [evaluating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05853) and [improving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09138) the consistency of language models.  

I was fortunate to collaborate via the [MLC community](https://mlcollective.org/community/) with [Yash](https://www.yash-sharma.com/) and [Laura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lfee-schneider/?locale=en_US) on quantifying the robustness transfer from pretraining to downstream tasks from the lens of computer vision.

I did my bachelor thesis with [Anil S. Parihar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JRr4wjoAAAAJ&hl=en) on Vision and Language Navigation (VLN) and fortunately, we secured a top-3 position in the most popular VLN challenge [R2R](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JRr4wjoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I also spent my summer internship during my undergrad at [Thoucentric](https://thoucentric.com/) as a researcher with [Manu](https://deep-and-shallow.com/about-me/) where I studied tabular data and built a [novel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08548) deep learning framework.

I am actively looking for PhD in Ai Safety starting Fall 2025.
